# I know very little about Sweave. The R syntax might not match. This repository may need rewriting. For now, R is the default template language, as based on my current knowledge, Sweave is a TeX layer for R.

# Project language file 1
# For: seanpm2001/Learn-Sweave
# About:
# I decided to make Sweave the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Sweave) as Sweave is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Sweave programming language. It only makes sense to Sweave the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
